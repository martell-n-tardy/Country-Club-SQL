/* Business Questions Explored in Country Club Case Study


/* Q1: Some of the facilities charge a fee to members, but some do not.
Write a SQL query to produce a list of the names of the facilities that do. */

A: SELECT `name` FROM `Facilities` WHERE `membercost` > 0.0

/* Q2: How many facilities do not charge a fee to members? */

A: SELECT COUNT(name) FROM `Facilities` WHERE `membercost` = 0.0

/* Q3: Write an SQL query to show a list of facilities that charge a fee to members,
where the fee is less than 20% of the facility's monthly maintenance cost.
Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the
facilities in question. */

A: 
SELECT `facid`,`name`,`membercost`,`monthlymaintenance` 
FROM `Facilities` 
WHERE `membercost` != 0 AND `membercost` < 0.2*`monthlymaintenance`

/* Q4: Write an SQL query to retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5.
Try writing the query without using the OR operator. */

A: SELECT * FROM `Facilities` WHERE `facid` IN (1,5)

/* Q5: Produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as
'cheap' or 'expensive', depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is
more than $100. Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities
in question. */

A: 
SELECT `name`,
	CASE WHEN `monthlymaintenance` > 100 THEN 'expensive'
		 ELSE 'cheap' END AS `monthlymaintenance`
FROM `Facilities`

/* Q6: You'd like to get the first and last name of the last member(s)
who signed up. Try not to use the LIMIT clause for your solution. */

A:
SELECT `firstname`, `surname`, `joindate` 
FROM `Members` 
ORDER BY `joindate` DESC

/* Q7: Produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court.
Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member
formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by
the member name. */

A:

	INNER JOIN `Members` AS m
		ON b.memid = m.memid
WHERE f.name IN ('Tennis Court 1', 'Tennis Court 2')
GROUP BY f.name, membername
ORDER BY membername

/* Q8: Produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which
will cost the member (or guest) more than $30. Remember that guests have
different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and
the guest user's ID is always 0. Include in your output the name of the
facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost.
Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries. */

A:

/* Q9: This time, produce the same result as in Q8, but using a subquery. */

A:
SELECT subquery.name, subquery.membername, subquery.cost
FROM (

/* PART 2: SQLite

Export the country club data from PHPMyAdmin, and connect to a local SQLite instance from Jupyter notebook 
for the following questions.

The output of facility name and total revenue, sorted by revenue. Remember
